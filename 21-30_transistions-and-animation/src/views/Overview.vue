    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Vue provides a variety of ways to apply transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. This includes tools to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>automatically apply classes for CSS transitions and animations</li>
      <li>integrate 3rd-party CSS animation libraries, such as Animate.css</li>
      <li>use JavaScript to directly manipulate the DOM during transition hooks</li>
      <li>integrate 3rd-party JavaScript animation libraries, such as Velocity.js</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On this page, weâ€™ll only cover entering, leaving, and list transitions, but you can see the next section for managing state transitions.</p>
